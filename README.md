This project includes several classic sorting algorithms: Shaker Sort, Heap Sort, Quick Sort, and Merge Sort. It also has an array generator in the main class. The goal is to make it easy to compare how these algorithms work, how fast they are, and how they are implemented.

SortingAlgorithmsBenchmark is the project folder used to benchmark each sorting algorithm counting the average comparisons as well as the 10 best and work permutations. To run, import the project into your IDE of choice and run main inside of ArrayGenerator.
